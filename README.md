# Simple-Risc-V-processor
This repository contains the Verilog files and the report for the "Digital HW Systems at Low Logic Levels I" course offered in the 7th semester of the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at Aristotle University of Thessaloniki. 
Contains an implementation of a RISC-V processor and the following parts of the processor are described through HDL:
- ALU
- Registers File
- Data Memory
- Instruction Memory
- Datapath
The processor operates as a Finite State Machine (FSM) with the states Instruction Fetch (IF), Instruction Decode (ID), Execute (EX), Memory Access (MEM), and Write Back (WB).
